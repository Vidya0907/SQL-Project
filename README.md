This project focuses on analyzing the Zomato restaurant dataset using SQL. It explores various aspects of the restaurant industry across countries, with a major focus on India. The analysis includes:

1. Rolling and moving counts of restaurants in Indian cities

2. Percentage distribution of restaurants across countries

3. Online delivery adoption rates by country

4. Identifying cities and localities with the highest and lowest number of restaurants

5. Cuisine and food popularity in high-density areas

6. Impact of table booking options on ratings

7. Average ratings location-wise

8. Filtering the best restaurants based on parameters like price range, votes, cost, cuisines, and ratings

The project demonstrates SQL concepts like CTEs (Common Table Expressions), Views, Aggregate Functions, Window Functions, and String Manipulation.
This analysis can help derive insights for business strategy, customer preferences, and operational decisions in the restaurant industry.
